    <h3>Let's take a look at the development of the GPS! </h3> </div>
    <p >
        Most people have used a GPS at least once in their lifeitmes. Whether that be to locate a lost phone or find your way around an unfamiliar city, 
        the GPS can come in very handy.GPS stands for Global Positioning Service, it was first created in 1973 and it has become more and more efficient 
        over the past 48 years. For that, we can thank the Aerospace Corporation , which have played a key role in advancing the modern GPS.

            <li>
                <span class= sputnik-text> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of creating a system that would help us navigate actually originated from space. 
                    It was during the space race, a time in which The Soviet Union and The United States were competing to show 
                    their superiority by traveling to space. Thanks to them we were able to send satellites into space and discover 
                    important things about earth and the galaxy we exist in. However, the he first large advancement for the gps 
                    was when Sputnik was launched. Russia sent Sputnik, the first satellite to ever orbit around the earth, into space in 
                    October 1957. Their mission was to transmit signals to Earth so that they could prove that the satellite was in orbit.
                    They  ended up discovering that the frequency of the satellite was actually <i>higher</i> when it 
                    was closer. They called this theory the Doppler Effect.  The Doppler Effect helped them come to 
                    the conclusion that they could determine the distance from the ground to the satellite by using 
                    the frequency shift of the radio signal. This opened up possibilities for scientists globally 
                    to take a shot at creating their own satellites to help them create a more efficient form of navigation. One of these satellites was named "Transit."
                </span>
            <p>
                <span class= quotes>"Each satellite orbits the earth every 12 hours in fashion that ensures that every point on the planet 
                will always be in radio contact with at least four satellites. Each satellite continuously broadcasts a radio signal that includes both its own position 
                and the exact time, exact to a billionth of a second."</span>

                <h4> &#127762 Transit</h4>
            <li>
                Transit was created by The Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1958, it was the world's first 
                global satellite navigation system. Transit's first satellite launched in 1960 and it was capable 
                of providing navigation services to the Navy missile submarines and to commercial users.

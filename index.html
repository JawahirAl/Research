    <h1>The History of the GPS</h1>
    <h3>Let's take a look at the development of the GPS! </h3>
    <p >
        Most people have used a GPS at least once in their lifeitmes. Whether that be to locate a lost phone or find your way around an unfamiliar city, 
        the GPS can come in very handy.GPS stands for Global Positioning Service, it was first created in 1973 and it has become more and more efficient 
        over the past 48 years. For that, we can thank the Aerospace Corporation , which have played a key role in advancing the modern GPS.

                The idea of creating a system that would help us navigate actually originated from space. 
                When Russia sent Sputnik, the first satellite to ever orbit around the earth, into space 
                they  discovered that the frequency of the satellite was actually <i>higher</i> when it 
                was closer. Thus concluding that they could determine the distance from the ground to the 
                satellite. This opened multiple possibilites such as "Transit."

                <h4>Transit</h4>
            <li>
                Transit was created by The Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1958, it was the world's first 
                global satellite navigation system. Transit's first satellite launched in 1960 and it was capable 
                of providing navigation services to the Navy missile submarines and to commercial users.

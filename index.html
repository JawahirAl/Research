        Most people have used a GPS at least once in their lifeitmes. Whether that be to locate a lost phone or find your way around an unfamiliar city, 
        the GPS can come in very handy. GPS stands for Global Positioning Service, it was first created in 1973 and it has become more and more efficient 
        over the past 48 years. For that, we can thank the Aerospace Corporation , which have played a key role in advancing the modern GPS.

            <h4>&#127761 Sputnik</h4>
            <ol>
                <span class= "sputnik-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of creating a system that would help us navigate actually originated from space. 
                    It was during the space race, a time in which The Soviet Union and The United States were competing to show 
                    their superiority by traveling to space. Thanks to them we were able to send satellites into space and discover 
                    important things about earth and the galaxy we exist in. However, the he first large advancement for the gps 
                    was when <i>Sputnik</i> was launched. Russia sent Sputnik, the first satellite to ever orbit around the earth, into space in 
                    October 1957. Their mission was to transmit signals to Earth so that they could prove that the satellite was in orbit.
                    They  ended up discovering that the frequency of the satellite was actually <i>higher</i> when it 
                    was closer. They called this theory the Doppler Effect.  The Doppler Effect helped them come to 
                    the conclusion that they could determine the distance from the ground to the satellite by using 
                    the frequency shift of the radio signal. This opened up possibilities for scientists globally 
                    to take a shot at creating their own satellites to help them create a more efficient form of navigation. One of these satellites was named "Transit."

            <p>
                <span class= quotes>"Each satellite orbits the earth every 12 hours in fashion that ensures that every point on the planet 
                will always be in radio contact with at least four satellites. Each satellite continuously broadcasts a radio signal that includes both its own position 
                and the exact time, exact to a billionth of a second."</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year after the entire world witnessed Sputnik orbiting the Earth, scientists in 
                        the US were desperate to catch up. <i>Transit</i> was created by The Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1958, it was the world's first 
                        global satellite navigation system. Transit's first satellite launched in 1960 and it was capable 
                        of providing navigation services to the Navy missile submarines and to commercial users. 
                        It was a smaller sattelite that had used solar power and "gravity-gradient stabilization."
                        It sent in a location every few hours. It sent signals to a submarines antenna 25-meters apart.
                        However if the submarine moved even a little bit the calculations would be flawed. 
                        It was adapted so that all US navy ships could use the naviagtion system. In 1967 Hubert Humphrey
                        offered the technology to the civilian community. In the effort towards our modern GPS, Transit 
                        developed an important technique "the use of two frequencies to calibrate the time delay of the 
                        radio signal induced by the ionosphere. This dual-frequency technique was incorporated into GPS to 
                        attain the highest positioning accuracy." (GPS WORLD)

                            <span class= quotes>"On this day in 1960 the US launched the first satellite in its TRANSIT naval navigation system. 
                            The satellites flew in five different low polar orbits while broadcasting at 150 and 400 MHz. From the set of Doppler 
                            shifts and the satellites' locations, a ship or submarine could derive its position with a precision of 200 meters. 
                            TRANSIT was the US Navy's principal satellite navigation system from 1964, when it became operational, until 1996, 
                            when GPS superseded it."</span>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Timation</i> was first launched in 1967 and last launched in 1969. They used a brand 
                               new technique on this satellite which involved a complicated system of highly 
                               accurate clocks. This provided longitude, lattitude, and altitude, a three 
                               dimensional system. Timation was merged with the Air Forces 621B program and 
                               formed the NAVSTAR gps program

                                <span class= quotes>" The naval lab backed the TIMATION program, which used 
                                    high-precision clocks to provide both accurate position and precise time 
                                    measurements to ground observers. The time measurements improved the system 
                                    by allowing more precise determinations of the satellite location and lengthening 
                                    the time between required position updates. Two TIMATION satellites, each bearing 
                                    a quartz clock accurate to one part per billion, were orbited: one in 1967 and the 
                                    other in 1969"</span>

                            <ol>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962 a doctor by the name of Ivan Getting, who was the president of the Aerospace 
                                Corporation decided that the corporation needed a new and improved satellite-based 
                                navigation system. Up until this point sattelites were only available in two dimensions. 
                                This along with making them function all day everyday were the next big changes in 
                                Global-Positioning-System. Ivan had full acess to the pentagon and was determined to
                                make this a huge military advantage. The Air Force named this new sattelite <i> 621B </i> and 
                                Getting was given an award for it in 2002.

                                    orbital configuration, orbital prediction, receiver accuracy, error analysis, 
                                    system cost, and comprehensive estimates of the tactical mission benefits.

                        The pentagon proposed <i> NAVSTAR</i> in 1973. Rick Sturdevant claims that "The main reasons 
                        for GPS development were the need to deliver weapons precisely on target, and to reverse 
                        the proliferation of navigation systems in the U.S. military." The Department of Defense 
                        however wanted it to be available to the public. Navstar was created to have 24 satelites 
                        in orbit. Navstar seven failed to reach orbit and only ten actually made it into space in 1980. 
                        Then in 1989 the first full-fledged GPS satellites were launched. Nine of the satellite
                        launched from 1989 to 1990.  

                        <p>

                                Developing GPS components began in 1973, when the Joint Program Office was established 
                                under the Air Force to run and maintain the system. As designs evolved, positioning and navigation accuracy improved
                                GPS resulted from a combination of parallel efforts in the 1960s. Defense Department 
                                planners decided to combine the best technologies from these various programs—the Navy’s 
                                Transit and TIMATION, the Air Force’s 621B, and the Army’s SECOR—into one. At a meeting 
                                over Labor Day weekend in 1973, they created the Defense Navigation Satellite System. 
                                It was later renamed the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System, now generally known as GPS."</span>

                        The <i>modern gps</i> accessible to the public uses 24 sattelites that all orbit the earth carrying extremely accurate
                        clocks. Out exact location is found using a triangulation method and distance mathematics. Gps 
                        are easily accessible now, you can just pull up your phone and find your exact location. There 
                        are also special websites such as google earth that can show a 3D view of where you are. It's not 
                        just for finding your location though a gps can also track stolen vehicles, track down lost pets, 
                        and food delivery apps use them to track their drivers! Gps also allow us to cut down on
                        traffic and help us to reduce our carbon footprint by finding the shortest and fastest possible 
                        route to our desired location.

                            GPS for civilian users took a leap forward in 2000 when Clinton authorized 
                            the end of "selective availability." Previously, civilians received a much 
                            "coarser" view of their position because the military manipulated factors 
                            such as orbital data or the frequency of the satellite's clock.
                            It wasn't long, however, before civilians feared the option could be 
                            turned on again. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, on the World Trade 
                            Center and Pentagon prompted a raft of new security measures. Six days after 
                            the attacks, the Interagency GPS Executive Board stated there was no change 
                            to the United States' policy: to not use selective availability again.
